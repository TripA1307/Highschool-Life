<h2>Things I wish you knew</h2>
<p>So i noticed you've unfollowed me and such in ig and that made me think</p>
<p>please don't think that heather or any of my current friends rn as the reason why i stopped being friends with you</p>
<p>It really did took me awhile to actually have some friends after you guys</p>
<p>I'll never forget the last paragraph you've sent to me, and I wish i gave you more of a proper goodbye</p>
<p>Really the only reason why i ended our friendship was because of toxicness and such, never because of a person</p>
<p>I wanted to greet you guys a merry christmas or smth, but I feel like you have some kind of grudge over me and I didn't wanna ruin christmas or anything for you</p>
<p>This message is not for us to be friends again, it is more of a closure, peace or yeah</p>
<p>I also want you to know that the things you've wished for me, having people that will treat me right, has become true:)</p>
<p>I am still adjusting to my new circle and such, and i have not forgotten ab you guys</p>
<p>I am not alone anymore, and I hope you're happy and living your life to the fullest even without me</p>
<p>Happy new years kelly, and merry christmas</p>

</body>
