<h2>A true homie</h2>
<p>THE homie I could always rely on, cry on, get advice from, and most of all, eat croissants and vibe with.</p>
<p>There has been so many chaotic, toxic, arguments, and really great memories from those 11 years we had</p>
<p>I honestly wouldn't change anything at all because I know we'll always be homies</p>
<p>Screw having a sure thing in relationships, I gotchu B))</p>
<p>You have seen me at my worst and my downs, I'll also be there for you</p>
<p>I know you know very well I dont know how to express my feelings well, but this was actually the easiest for me because it's you</p>
<p>I wouldn't ask for another homie unless it's you, I think you have been the truest, purest, friend i have ever had and i'll be forever thankful of that</p>
<p>I haven't been fair to you always, and I'd like to make up for those</p>
<p>Happy new years buddy, love you very much, see you next year <3</p>
